# MusicOrganizer

I've always been a huge music fan. I have CDs, LPs, DVDs, mp3 and all this stuff. I used to organize of the music that I download, but you download a lot of stuff this can become boring, a huge boring thing that you need to do to keep yours musics findable.
Well, with this proposal, I've decided to write this program to organize my music files based on their ID3v1/v2 tag, separating by Artists, Albums and renaming the song with tracknumber. I've wrote almost everything of this in September of 2009, but now I'm trying to make this better.

# Caution

1. This is a development IN-PROGRESS project, do not use this with ALL your songs; 
2. There's a checkbox that is used to delete or not the original files. I suggest that you do not use this while in developing. You can lose some songs;
4. If your files do not have ID3v1/v2 tags or they are wrong, DON'T USE THIS;
3. The implementation of recursive search of files still being codded.
